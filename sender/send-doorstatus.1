.SH NAME
send\-doorstatus.sh \- Read door status and post updates to an HTTP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
.B send-doorstatus.sh
.PP
(No flags needed or supported)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B send-doorstatus.sh
reads the open/close state of a simple switch door sensor and sends any changes
in the state to an HTTP server.
An NTP server is used to regularly update the time on the client so it can be
transmitted along with the value for verification.
.PP
The data submitted is secured by a cryptographic verification code generated
from a shared secret, the name of the sensor, the submitted state and the
current time stamp as seconds since Jan 1 1970, all represented in ASCII.
.PP
The value is checked every 30 seconds and reported only upon change.
.SH FILES
.PP
.B send-doorstatus.sh
reads the file
.I .doorky/config
in the home directory of the user invoking it.
.PP
However, all values can also be read from environment variables.
.PP
Additionally, the contents of the file
.I .doorky/secret
are used as a shared secretfor encryption purposes.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
.PP
The
.I .doorky/config
configuration file needs to be shell formatted, so ideally all values should be
specified as
.IR key =
.I "value"
pairs.
Case sensitive matters.
.PP
The following configuration settings are supported:
.TP
.BI DOORSTATUS_SERVER " required
Name of the HTTP server to submit the data to via HTTP.
Can be specified as
.I hostname
or
.IR hostname : port .
.TP
.BI NTP_SERVER " required
Name or address of an NTP server to use for making sure the time is up to date.
.TP
.BI DOORNAME " optional
Alphanumeric string identifying the door sensor.
This must match the value specified on the server side.
Default:
.I door
.PP
The
.I .doorky/secret
configuration file only contains the secret with no formatting whatsoever.
.SH "EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION"
.PP
An example configuration file might look just about like this:
.PP
.RS 0
DOORSTATUS_SERVER="door.api.example.org"
.RS 0
NTP_SERVER="pool.ntp.org"
.RS 0
DOORNAME="alfred"
